# Jupyter Notebook Installation Guide

This guide will help you install and set up Jupyter Notebook on your system. Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.

## Prerequisites

Before you install Jupyter Notebook, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python**: Python 3.7 or later is recommended.
- **pip**: The Python package installer, which is used to install Jupyter and other packages.

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install Python and pip

If you don't have Python installed, you can download and install it from the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

To check if Python is installed, open a terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
python --version

```sh
docker run --user jupyter -it -d --name jupyter-server --hostname jupyter-server --restart=always -p 8888:8888 msc/jupyter
```
